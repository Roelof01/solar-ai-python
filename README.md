How to improve solar panels using Artificial Intelligence build with python
I am interested in Artificial Intelligence. Lot of new ideas / plans at the moment. Robots / Artificial Intelligence is hot.
Big companies like Google, IBM and MicroSoft are teaming up. This indicates that we will have significant breakthroughs around the corner.
What sparked my imagination was story that NASA used AI to improve Antenae design for their Marslander. AI came up with what engineers thought was a very strange shape somewhat in the form of a paperclip but they build it and it worked. Solar Panels have my interest and I think that big breakthrough in energy i/o conversion rate is required to reduce the years required to earn back your investment.So perhaps AI can help here.
