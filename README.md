Objective is to improve solar panels energy output using Artificial Intelligence build with python
I am interested in Artificial Intelligence. Lot of new ideas / plans at the moment. Robots / Artificial Intelligence is hot.
Big companies like Google, IBM and MicroSoft are teaming up. This indicates that we will have significant breakthroughs around the corner.
What sparked my imagination was story that NASA used AI to improve Antenae design for their Marslander. AI came up with what engineers thought was a very strange shape somewhat in the form of a paperclip but they build it and it worked. Solar Panels have my interest and I think that big breakthrough in energy i/o conversion rate is required to reduce the years required to earn back your investment.So perhaps AI can help here. I am on a steep learning curve:
Phase 0: Read as much available literature on AI, Python and Solar Panels
Phase 1: Learn Basics of AI, Python and Solar Panels
Phase 2: Check availability of material that covers all three subjects in one article, book, publication or thesis
Phase 3: Try to find complicated AI models. What programming language, data sources, brute-force vs selflearning etc etc
Phase 4: Deep Dive
Phase 4.1 Learn Python Programminng 
Phase 4.2 Learn AI / Machine Learning principles. 
Phase 4.3 Use Python to make simple AI models
Phase 4.4 Learn Solar Panelsbasics / mechanics / design
Phase 4.5 Make AI model in Python for Solar Panels
